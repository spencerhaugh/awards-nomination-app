# Shopify Movie Nominations!

Live Site: [Nomination App!](https://silly-benz-d7b4f7.netlify.app/)  

This App is built with React and calls on the OMDB API to search for movies titles to add to a list of nominations.  
You can add and remove nominated movies from the list. You cannot add a movie that has already been added.  
Only movies are returned from the API call, series and television programs are not returned.  
The App is completely responsive and looks great on any size screen.  

Once the user has made 5 nominations, the completed banner is displayed, and new titles can no longer be search for or added. However, if a nomination is removed after the banner has been displayed, the App goes back to standard functionality.  

This App does not allow for empty search strings, nor does it display Error API responses due to misspellings and other user errors.  
This App runs smoothly with zero warnings or other concerns noted in the console or browser dev tools.  

This App scores 100 on a Lighthouse test for Accessibility.
